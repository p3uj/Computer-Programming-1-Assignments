### Create a program that will calculate the following:
#### Instruction
It was 1985 when the President decreed that the rebel Bareng be evicted from the Philippines for his crimes. 

The President’s order is that Bareng is to be taken to sea and left to wander in a small boat possibly to find the nearest civilization (200 miles away from the Philippines). Bareng is also given 5 days ration of food and water. Displaying his compassion, the President had Bareng taken 50 miles in the correct direction. Bareng then begins sailing. Initially, he is able to sail 20 miles/day. However, after each day, he becomes weaker and weaker so his rate decreases by 1 mile/day. Also, he loses 2 miles of those he gained each day to wind and seastorm that blows him backward. Although Bareng can stretch his ration of food and water, he will collapse and die on the 13th day of wandering.

Create a program that will calculate:

a. The day, rate and miles he has to travel each day.

b. The day when Bareng collapses or reaches civilization.

### Calculate how long it will take to fill the bucket.
#### Instruction
Margaret River Wine Company wants to determine how long it will take a leaking barrel to fill the bucket underneath it. 

The bucket holds 2,452 drops of wine. The barrel leaks at a rate of 162 drops/hour. At the end of every 3 hours, a cat drinks 28 drops of wine from the bucket. 

Create a program to calculate how long it will take to fill the bucket. 
Present the output in an hour by hour basis. How many drops of wine did the cat drink?
