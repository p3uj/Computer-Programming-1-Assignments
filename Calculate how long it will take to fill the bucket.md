# Calculate how long it will take to fill the bucket.


### Instruction
Margaret River Wine Company wants to determine how long it will take a leaking barrel to fill the bucket underneath it. 

The bucket holds 2,452 drops of wine. The barrel leaks at a rate of 162 drops/hour. At the end of every 3 hours, a cat drinks 28 drops of wine from the bucket. 

Create a program to calculate how long it will take to fill the bucket. 
Present the output in an hour by hour basis. How many drops of wine did the cat drink?
