## 1. STATEMENT
### Week's wage of an employee
#### Instruction
Create a program that will compute for the week’s wage of an employee. Input hours worked and rate per hour.

If hours worked is greater than 40, then the employee is entitled to an overtime pay which rate per hour is ½ greater than his/her hourly rate.  The overtime rate is applied only to the excess hours beyond 40 hours.

Display the week’s wage of the employee.
